                  The world is recalibrating. The old paradigms are shifting, and in this new geopolitical and economic landscape, Africa emerges not as a spectator but as the definitive arena of opportunity. The Africa Economic Forum is the platform where this new reality is forged.

                  We are <strong>The African Table</strong>. It is Africa that extends the invitation, sets the agenda, and defines the terms of a truly strategic, win-win cooperation. Our model is deliberate: a perpetual, year-long journey across the continent, diving deep into each critical sector. We move from high-level consensus to granular deal-making, ensuring that every conversation is purpose-driven and outcome-oriented.

                <p className="text-justify">
                  A cornerstone of our model is <strong>strategic co-creation</strong>. Each forum is hosted by a sovereign nation that is a leading partner and sponsor, demonstrating its commitment to leading the continental agenda in that specific sector. This ensures the highest level of government engagement and deal-making potential.

                  In 2026, we confront the theme of <strong>'Global Realignments'</strong> head-on. This is more than a topic; it is our operational reality. We will connect global capital with Africa's immense opportunities, build the alliances that matter, and unlock strategic value that has been waiting for the right moment—and the right platform.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              For decades, Africa has been the subject of conferences designed elsewhere. The AEF reverses this dynamic. It positions Africa as a <strong>global convening power</strong>, not a beneficiary of external goodwill. It is where African heads of state, finance ministers, and sovereign wealth funds align their strategies with the world's leading investors, development institutions, and industrial actors.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed font-semibold text-blue-900">
              The Perpetual Forum ensures continuity. The African Table ensures sovereignty. The Host Country Partnership ensures execution.

              This is how Africa designs its future, sector by sector, deal by deal.
